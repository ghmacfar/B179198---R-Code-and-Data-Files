Data manipulation description:

I was unable to figure out how to merge biomarkers.xlsx and covariates.xlsx with R. Instead, I manipulated the data by hand. This resulted in two data sheets- fulldata.csv and inclusiondata.csv. fulldata.csv includes the combined information on biomarker levels AND covariates in one sheet, and also includes inclusion VAS scores and 12-month VAS scores for each patient (although these are stored in the same column). Patients were ordered by number as some were out of place. I could then pull out only the inclusion data by pulling every row that included "0weeks" using the %like% command in R. Following this, the difference between males and females for each biomarker at inclusion could be investigated statistically. 

The inclusion of the covariates was necessary to create the linear model, which is why covariates and biomarker levels needed to be merged into one sheet. However, fulldata.csv includes all VAS data in one column, (because each patient has a row for 0 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 months), which makes comparisons between inclusion VAS and 12-month VAS difficult. To resolve this, all rows including "0weeks" were placed into a separate dataset using R, resulting in a set including all information on covariates, biomarkers, and VAS scores at inclusion. I then added the corresponding 12-month VAS score for each patient to this sheet by hand. This new sheet was named "inclusiondata.csv" and was utilized to create the linear model. 

Patient 40 was excluded from inclusiondata (and sex:biomarker level analysis) because there was no data associated with this patient at week 0. Patients 42 and 51 had no VAS data for month 12, but it was assumed that R would automatically exclude these from the linear model due to the missing value, so they were not manually removed.
